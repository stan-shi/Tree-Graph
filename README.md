#### For a random forests, we are going to to find out a leaf node from each tree such that these leaf nodes are consistent with each other. For the definition of consistency, it means that the rules each leaf generated from would have intersection. From the perspective of a graph, each vertex is a leafnode. Each edge means that these two vertices (leaf nodes) are consistent with each other.
